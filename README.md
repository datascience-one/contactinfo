# Contact infomation  Harvester.
Python package that crawls website and extracts Contact Information such as email id, office address, phone number and social media url.
This was a package initially developed by [Data Science Academy](https://datascience.one) and its parent company [Curvelogics](https://curvelogics.com) for internal use. However, as we did not find any good open source python package in the public domain that makes it easy to crawl and extract contact information, we decided to open source it.
